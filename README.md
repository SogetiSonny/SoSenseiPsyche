## Description
Mastermind is a classic game where the player must guess the computer's secret code. The secret code consists of a sequence of 4 letters, each representing a color:

- G for Green
- B for Blue
- Y for Yellow
- R for Red
- P for Pink
- W for White
- O for Orange
- S for Silver

The player receives feedback after each guess:
- `O` (Circle) for a letter that is correct and in the correct position.
- `X` (Cross) for a letter that is correct but in the wrong position.
- No symbol means that the letter is not part of the secret code.

The player has a maximum of 12 attempts to guess the secret code.
